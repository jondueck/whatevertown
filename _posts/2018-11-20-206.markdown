Would You Rather…
- …walk backwards for the rest of your life, or walk on all fours for the rest of your life? (Thanks [Brandon](https://twitter.com/thebranbran/status/1058166018495967237)!)
- …live in a space-based dwelling (like the ISS) or an underwater dwelling (like [La Chalupa Research Laboratory](https://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nur08013.htm)). Mobility is a key feature, so you can explore. (Thanks Kelsey!)
