## Would you rather…
- …live in a world that is one giant ball pit or in a world where every time it rained the earth would be a giant kiddie pool for 3 days then go back to normal? (Thanks Brenton!)
- …receive the ability of flight or being able to hold your breath for a day at a time? (Thanks Jeff!)

## Vs
- Superwoman vs The Flash (Thanks Brandon!)
