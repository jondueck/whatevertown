### Would You Rather…
- …​only wear one colour or each day or have to wear seven colours each day?
-…​always be slightly cold or slightly warm?
-…​have a shower that keeps you clean for seven days, or a bed that gives you a full nights rest in one hour?
-…​be able to run through walls but all your clothes stay on the other side, or have to run full speed for a 50/50 chance of running through the wall, but you get to keep your clothes on.
