### [43:32] – Would You Rather…
- "…be given $200,000 dollars, BUT you can only spend $20,000 a month. Also, all of the money smells of excrement – there is no way to get rid of the smell even if it is in a bag – and you have to carry all of the money on you at all times. Or be given a really nice cologne." (Thanks Brenton!)
