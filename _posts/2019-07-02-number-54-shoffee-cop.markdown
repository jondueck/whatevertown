### Would you ratherâ€¦
- â€¦always be the centre of attention or never be noticed, for the rest of your life? ðŸ˜¬ Centre of attention ie. always being watched, always being asked questions, never being left alone. Never noticed as in, you go your parentsâ€™ or friendâ€™s house and arenâ€™t acknowledged or given any attention to speak of. (Thanks Alissa!)
