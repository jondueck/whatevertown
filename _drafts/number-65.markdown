## How Do You Take Your Coffee?
- Coffee smells:  Freshly opened bag v Freshly ground v Fresh cup.

## The Biz
- Superstars ‚≠êÔ∏è & Rockstars ü§ò

## Would You ~~Rather~~‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶smoke three cigarettes a day for five years to receive $5,000,000 (CAD) immediately (money turns to debt if the streak of 3√ó/day is broken)? If not, how many days would you do this for in exchange for $5M? (Thanks for the submission, Chris!)
