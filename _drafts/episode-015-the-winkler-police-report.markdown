### Would you rather…
- …drink a litre of hot sauce, or a litre of hand lotion?
- …get a free [Whitecap](https://drinkwhitecap.com/) V60 coffee every day but it gives you minor indigestion/gas for three hours, or have to drink a Tim Horton's double-double every day and as you receive the coffee, you have to see "Ooo, I love me a good Timmy's coffee!" followed by taking a very loud sip. 
- …win a year trip to Europe with $2000.00 a month included, or get to spend 10 minutes on the moon
