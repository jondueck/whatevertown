Thanks for listening to Season 2. We had a lot of fun making it and we hope that you had fun listening to it. We introduced a new segment, "How Do You Take Your Coffee?", talked to some new friends and some old friends, started a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/whatevertown).

After [Episode #54](https://whatevertown.com/episode-54/), we'll be taking a break over the summer. We're going to take some time to relax and plan for the next season, which should start in September.

In the mean time, please [take part in our survey](https://whatevertown.typeform.com/to/oS50hM). This will help us refine Season 3 to be more in line with what you want to hear. It's anonymous, so you can be honest.
