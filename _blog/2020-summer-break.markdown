[Episode 75](/episode-75) is our Season 3 finale. We’ll take a break over summer to plan for Season 4 and to work on a side-project that we’ve been recording throughout the past season.

Thank you to our guests ([Gregg Neufeld](2019/11/26/number-62/), and [Jeremy Klassen](episode-60/)) for joining us.

Thank you to our [Patreon supporters](https://patreon.com/whatevertown) for helping us cover the costs of hosting and equipment. We say it in every post-show, but it really does mean a lot to us that you’re willing to spend money on us.

Most importantly, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to listen to an episode. We hope that it’s been a source of laughter, entertainment, fun, and whatever.

We might pop in a couple times throughout the summer, but you can expect us back for Season 4 in the fall.
