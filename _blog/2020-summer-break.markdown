[Episode 75](/episode-75) is our Season 3 finale. Weâ€™ll take a break over summer to plan for Season 4.

Thank you to our guests ([Gregg Neufeld](2019/11/26/number-62/), and [Jeremy Klassen](episode-60/)) for joining us.

We might pop in a couple times throughout the summer, but you can expect us back for Season 4 in the fall.
